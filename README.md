## Changes after fork

### 2025-10-25 - Simplification and cleanup
- No changes to actuall library code, except removed MediatR.Contracts project/namespace as it only contained
  interfaces, which were moved to MediatR namespace
- Removed many 3rd party dependencies and examples (Autofac, Dryloc, Lamar, LightInject, Stashbox, Windsor)
- Refactored unit tests to not use 3rd party libraries (like Lamar) but instead .NET CORE libraries only
- Added global build properties
- Added central package versions
- Removed logos, workflows (non essential files)
- Update to .NET 9
